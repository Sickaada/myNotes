## OOP in Python
- Class is like blueprint of the object. Based on that blueprint, we create our objects ( instance of a class) of that class.
- When a Class is created, an object(let's say 'x') is also created with same name and give access to different attributes as well as we can
   instantiate new objects.
 - Creating new objects from that automatically created 
    new_object = x()
 - Method of an object is corresponding function of the class it belongs to.
